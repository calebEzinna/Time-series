## Introduction

Time series analysis is a branch of statistics and data analysis that deals with data points collected over time. It involves studying patterns, trends, and dependencies within the data to make predictions or gain insights. This repository provides code examples and resources to help you understand and apply time series analysis techniques.

## Installation

To use the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels


Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation: Autocorrelation (ACF) measures the correlation between a time series and its lagged values, while partial autocorrelation (PACF) measures the correlation between a time series and its lagged values after removing the effects of intervening lags. These can help identify the order of the autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components in an ARIMA model.

ARIMA Model: ARIMA stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a popular model used for forecasting time series data. ARIMA models have three components: autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA). The AR component captures the linear relationship between the observation and its lagged values, the I component removes trends and seasonality by differencing, and the MA component models the error term as a linear combination of past error terms.

Seasonality: Many time series exhibit seasonal patterns, where the values repeat at regular intervals. Seasonal decomposition is a technique to separate a time series into its trend, seasonality, and residual components. This can be done using the seasonal_decompose function from the statsmodels library.

Forecasting: Once you have fitted a model, you can use it to make forecasts for future time periods. The predict method in statsmodels allows you to generate predictions based on the fitted model. You can specify the start and end periods for the forecast, as well as the type of forecast (e.g., levels or differences).

Model Evaluation: It's important to evaluate the performance of your time series model. Common evaluation metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). You can compare these metrics between different models or against a baseline to assess the accuracy of your forecasts.
